    "# Retrieval Augmented Question & Answering with Amazon Bedrock using LangChain & Vector Search\n",
    "> *This notebook should work well with the **`Data Science 3.0`** kernel in SageMaker Studio*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we used the Anthropic Claude model in Amazon Bedrock to demonstrate a basic Question Answering (QA) system, and learned the value of grounding a model with additional context before generating a response. In the previous notebook, we had to manually provide the model with relevant data and context ourselves. However, this approach is not fit for enterprise-level QA systems where there could be hundreds of thousands of large documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can improve upon this process by implementing an architecture called retrieval augmented generation (RAG). RAG retrieves data from outside the LLM's training data sources and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data as context. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, without needing to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we augment LLM responses to user queries by implementing RAG using context from external documents. First, we process documents and store these into a vector store. Next, we search the vector store using the user's question, and return relevant data as external context to the LLM. Finally, the LLM generates an answer to the user's question based on the new context provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through implementing the following two patterns: Question Answering (QA) and Conversational AI with conversation memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the solution a little further. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare documents for search\n",
    "![Documents](./images/embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the documents must be processed and then indexed in a vector store.\n",
    "- Load the documents from our directory\n",
    "- Process the documents by splitting them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using an embeddings model\n",
    "- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Respond to the user’s question\n",
    "![Question](./images/chatbot_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vector store is indexed with documents and embeddings, we can search for text relevant to the question being asked. The relevant chunks are sent to the model as additional context, where the model will then generate the answer.\n",
    "- Create an embedding of the input question\n",
    "- Compare the question embedding with the embeddings in the index\n",
    "- Fetch the (top N) relevant document chunks\n",
    "- Add those chunks as part of the context in the prompt\n",
    "- Send the prompt to the model under Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- Get the contextual answer based on the documents retrieved\n",

    "We will utilize a few different techniques when loading the documents that will help improve the retrieval quality.\n",

    "#### Outline based splitting\n",
    "By default LangChain's `PyPDFLoader` will break each document up into pages. We could then potentially use a chunking strategy such as `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to further break down the pages into smaller chunks. \n",
    "However, this could lead to suboptimal results if the most relevant information we are looking for is split across multiple pages. Instead, we will split the documents into sections based on the documents own table of contents. The implementation for this approach is provided in the rag_utils.outline_parser module [(source)](./rag_utils/outline_parser.py).\n",
    "Note that this approach only works on PDFs that contain a table of contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parent Document Retriever\n",
    "After we've loaded the document as individual sections, we will further split these sections by paragraphs using the [RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter/). These are the chunks that will be used for embeddings, however during retrieval we'll utilize the [ParentDocumentRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/parent_document_retriever/) to retrieve the entire section that the chunk belongs to. This is done to ensure that the context provided to the model is as complete as possible.\n"

This works well in many applications. However, in the case of extremely large datasets with high dimensionality, this creates a scaling problem that reduces the efficiency of the search. Approximate k-NN search methods can overcome this by employing tools that restructure indexes more efficiently and reduce the dimensionality of searchable vectors. Using this approach requires a sacrifice in accuracy but increases search processing speeds appreciably.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Loading documents and processing them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Creating a vector store using FAISS\n",
    "- Generating embeddings with an embeddings model\n",
    "- Searching the vector store to retrieve context relevant to the question\n",
    "- Performing Generative Question Answering using foundation models\n",
    "- Improving trust in our system by providing citations with every answer\n",
    "- Preparing prompt templates to use as input to the LLM\n",
    "- Storing conversation memory and providing the history as context to the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps\n",
    "- Experiment with different vector stores\n",
    "- Leverage various text and embedding models available through Amazon Bedrock to see alternate outputs\n",
    "- Explore options such as persistent storage of embeddings and document chunks\n",
    "- Use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, a fully managed RAG capability with built-in session context management\n",
