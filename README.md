## Fidelity Generative AI Bootcamp

Welcome to the Generative AI Bootcamp! Happy New Year ! In this 3 days in-person event, you will gain hands-on experience with the latest techniques in generative AI using Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker and other AWS services.

Generative AI is one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields in technology today. Foundation Models(FMs) are capturing the world's imagination with their ability to generate human-like text, images, and more from short text prompts.

In this bootcamp, you will learn how to leverage these powerful large language models (LLMs) to build your own generative AI applications. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on labs, you will cover topics like:

Accessing state-of-the-art LLMs like Anthropic's Claude and Meta's LLaMA using Amazon Bedrocks and SageMaker
Crafting effective prompts using prompt engineering techniques
Building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with vector databases for robust question answering
Optimizing and deploying LLMs for cost-effective inference using techniques like model quantization and Low-Rank Adaptation
Fine-tuning LLMs with methods like Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
The bootcamp culminates in a capstone project where you will apply everything you've learned to build an end-to-end generative AI application.

Over the next three days, you will gain the skills needed to harness the power of generative AI using AWS. Whether you want to build creative apps, improve search and QA systems, or generate content, this bootcamp will equip you with the latest techniques on the leading edge of AI.

We are looking forward to this exciting journey with you into the world of generative AI!
