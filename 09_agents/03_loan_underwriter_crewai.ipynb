    "Loan underwriting is a critical process that evaluates a borrower's financial stability and creditworthiness to determine loan approval. The process begins with the submission of key documents, including the loan application, which details the borrower's personal and financial information. Additional required documents typically include W-2 forms, credit reports, payslips, bank statements, and tax returns, all of which help underwriters assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. These documents provide insights into the borrower's employment history, income stability, outstanding debts, and overall financial obligations. A thorough review of financial information, including banking transactions, existing loans, payment history, and income sources, ensures that the borrower meets the lender’s risk assessment criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all documentation is verified, the underwriting process follows a structured set of underwriting guidelines to determine the risk level associated with approving the loan. These guidelines typically include an evaluation of the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, credit score, and adherence to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lending standards. Underwriters also conduct fraud checks and verify compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The underwriting process may involve automated underwriting systems (AUS) to analyze the applicant's financial health and risk profile. After completing the assessment, the underwriter issues a decision—approval, conditional approval, or denial—based on the applicant’s financial capacity and adherence to lending requirements."

    "## CrewAI Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging CrewAI, an agentic AI system can automate and streamline loan underwriting process using specialized AI agents. These agents can work collaboratively to extract, retrieve, and process financial information efficiently, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. This system consists of four key agents: an OCR Agent for document processing, an SQL Agent for financial data retrieval, an Underwriter Guideline Agent for policy checks, and an Underwriter Supervisor Agent to coordinate the entire underwriting decision-making process.\n",

    "\n",
    "The OCR Agent is responsible for extracting and structuring data from key financial documents, such as loan applications, W-2 forms, credit reports, payslips, and tax returns. This agent integrates Amazon Textract, a powerful OCR tool, to scan and convert document-based information into structured digital formats. Once extracted, the data is cleaned and formatted for further processing by downstream agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. SQL Agent – Retrieving Loan Applicant’s Financial Data using Text2SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL Agent connects to a structured database (SQL-based system) to fetch relevant financial details of the loan applicant. Using Text2SQL conversion, this agent translates natural language queries (e.g., “What is the applicant’s monthly income and outstanding loan balance?”) into SQL queries that retrieve the necessary financial records. It extracts banking transactions, outstanding loan amounts, payment history, income sources, and credit utilization, providing a comprehensive financial profile of the borrower.\n",

    "**3. Underwriter Guideline Agent – Ensuring Compliance with Loan Underwriting Policies**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Underwriter Guideline Agent connects to Amazon Bedrock’s Knowledge Base to retrieve underwriting guidelines dynamically. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this agent provides contextual information regarding Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, Debt-to-Income (DTI) limits, credit score requirements, employment history criteria, and anti-money laundering (AML) checks. \n",

    "**4. Underwriter Supervisor Agent – Coordinating Agents and Generating Loan Decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Underwriter Supervisor Agent acts as the orchestrator, coordinating all the other agents to produce a final underwriting decision.It generates an underwriting report summarizing key factors, risk assessments, and policy adherence, ensuring transparency and explainability in loan decisions."

The Information Verification Agent then queries financial databases, retrieving key details such as income, outstanding debts, and credit history using Text2SQL conversion.
